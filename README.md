# movies
## Movies is a simple flutter app that shows some movies depending on search words.
This application contains two screens. <br />
The first screen contains a search bar so the user can type the movie name he wants. <br />
While the user types in the search bar a grid of movies shows on the screen. <br />
The items of movies in the grid are clickable so once the user clicks on one of these movies it will take him to the second screen that contains more details about this movie. <br />
The second screen shows the movie poster, its name, the synopsis, and the cast. <br />
